ðŸŒŸ 100 Days of Code: Flutter Developer Journey ðŸŒŸ

Day 5: #100DaysOfCode challenge ðŸš€ Today, I dove deeper into Stateless and Stateful widgets as well as learning the fundamental of building blocks of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects.

I covered the following:
1. Modularising codebase into separate classes.
2. Dart classes and objects.
3. Using class constructors.
4. Extracting Widgets to refactor a codebase.
5. private and public modifiers in Dart.
6. How to use Dart lists.
7. The difference between var, const and final.

After these learning these, I completed Quizzler - a quiz app.

NB:
Next update will be on Monday as I will take the weekend to rest and reflect on the concepts I've learned all week.
